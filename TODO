1) more SPLUNK dashboards for the java.lang domain

2) jvmDescription attribute , allow this to be dynamically set from the value of a particular mbean attribute

3) jmxport, jmxpass, jmxuser...abstract this out so as to avoid potential unnecessary repetition in the config xml

4) better quality docs, README has heaps of content but is a tad ugly.Also add docs for XSD and Formatter API

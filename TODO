TODO Items
----------

* more SPLUNK dashboards for the java.lang domain

* scheduled searches,alerts,reports for the java.lang domain

* jvmDescription attribute , allow this to be dynamically set from the value of a particular mbean attribute

* jmxport, jmxpass, jmxuser...abstract these out so as to avoid potential unnecessary repetition in the config xml

* formatted user guide, the README has heaps of content, but is just ugly.

* autodiscovery of JVMs, local and remote

* extract "all mbeans and attributes" functionality

* become the defacto standard for JMX monitoring :)

1) more SPLUNK dashboards for the java.lang domain

2) jvmDescription attribute , allow this to be dynamically set from the value of a particular mbean attribute

3) jmxport, jmxpass, jmxuser...abstract this out so as to avoid potential unnecessary repetition in the config xml

4) formatted user guide, the README has heaps of content, but is just ugly.

5) XSD doc generated
